<h3 class="red">Introduction</h3>
</center>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; It is worth asking, what makes the show "Doctor Who" as popular as it is. There are obviously a vast number of British television shows, and yet this show in particular has had mainstream success and a cult following since its inception in the 60's, as well as, its reboot in 2005. Is the lore really that interesting? Are the characters really that likeable? Did the Doctor somehow make a deal with the Devil? All valid questions, but like the question of how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie-pop...the world may never know.</p>

<h3 class="red">The Dataset</h3>
</center>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; For this study, a dataset that aggregates IMDB ratings and the scripts of the modern reboot to conduct NLP on through sentiment analysis. While this may not be the best indicator of why "Doctor Who" is as popular as it is, it's as good a place as any to begin the examination. As can be seen in the above chart, the ratings data is somewhat biased in the most recent season as the additon of a female iteration of The Doctor received some backlash due to sexism and/or gender bias. The subsequent negative reviews caused a drop in the show's rating, though not necessarily its popularity.</p>

<h3 class="red">Comparisons and References</h3>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Obviously, research looking into what makes a TV show popular has been conducted, hence the popularity of Netflix Original shows. This article (<a href="https://www.forevergeek.com/great-tv-series-factors/" >TV Series Factors<a/>) explores this research in 10 concise points, and, interestingly enough, includes "Doctor Who" as an example for 'rewarding attentive fans' with easter eggs, running jokes, and overlapping character arcs. Another article (<a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/good-tv-show">10 More Things</a>) claims that dynamic characters are an important characteristic of any great TV show. If only Doctor Who didn't have one singular protagonist...oh wait! It doesn't, instead, the show uses a deutoragonist method with a rotating, and sometimes recurring, second to The Doctor. The Doctor is also a dynamic character as upon 'death', The Doctor reincarnates with a new appearance and somewhat different quirks. It would seem then, that "Doctor Who"'s popularity is due to its inherent greatness. When compared with other 'great' TV shows with cult-like followings, Doctor Who is still distinct. Star Wars had a well established following long before the 2008 animated series was released to critical acclaim and yet, when we compare both the ratings, and number of ratings these two shows have received, there still exists that distinction. If we compare <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458290/?ref_=kw_li_tt">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436992/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Doctor Who (2005)</a> the reader will see that not only is "Doctor Who" rated an 8.6 whereas SW: TCW only has an 8.3. Possibly more telling is the number of ratings as SW: TCW has only received 31.85% of "Doctor Who"'s ratings even though the shows' release dates are not all that separate.</p>

<h3 class="red">The Data</h3>
</center>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Upon examining the "Doctor Who" dataset with NLTK and Vader analysis, we find another interesting piece of "Doctor Who": it is surprisingly neutral. In terms of language used, within the show, very rarily is it excessively positive or negative.</p>

</center>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The above infographic demonstrates the distribution of word occurences as scored by the Vader sentiment analysis. This is an important characteristic as the neutrality of language can have implications on its audience. Where an excessively negative language set might be found in serial killer documentaries or action movies, that form of language and content is not necessarily widely appealing to the greatest number of people. Perhaps, were SW: TCW not animated, it may have received greater viewership <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8111088/">like the Mandolorian</a>. Thus, "Doctor Who"'s neutral language allows it to be approachable by just about anyone.
